Welcome to DeepForest's documentation!
======================================

DeepForest is a python package for predicting individual tree crowns from RGB imagery.
Source code is available here: (https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest.git). 

# Status Update (May 25th 2021)

While this repo is actively maintained, the most current data and model has been moved to https://deepforest-pytorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Long-term we expect to update the pytorch branch more frequently, as the requirement for tensorflow=1.14.0 for deepforest is a potential hindarence to mantainance. Unless there is a compelling reason, use deepforest-pytorch and not this repo. No breaking errors or changes are known at this time.
